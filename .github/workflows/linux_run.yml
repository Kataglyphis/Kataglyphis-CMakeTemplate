How can I install latest cmake in a github dünner ubjntu 24.04

Nachgedacht für 24 Sekunden
Summary
On Ubuntu 24.04 (including GitHub Actions runners based on ubuntu-24.04), the stock APT package for CMake is often several versions behind the upstream release. To get the latest CMake you can choose one of the following approaches:

Kitware APT repository – adds the official Kitware packages to your system and keeps them up-to-date via apt 
apt.kitware.com
.

Snap – installs the very latest release (and updates automatically) 
GitLab
.

Official binary installer – downloads a self-extracting installer directly from CMake.org 
CMake
.

GitHub Action – uses a marketplace action to install CMake in your workflow, ideal for CI 
GitHub
.

Below are step-by-step instructions for each method.

1. Using the Kitware APT Repository
This is the recommended way if you want to continue using your system’s package manager.

# 1. Remove any old CMake
sudo apt remove --purge --auto-remove cmake

# 2. Install prerequisites
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wget gnupg lsb-release ca-certificates

# 3. Add Kitware’s signing key
wget -O - https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/kitware-archive-keyring.gpg

# 4. Add the Kitware repo for Ubuntu 24.04
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kitware-archive-keyring.gpg] \
  https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kitware.list

# 5. Update and install the latest CMake
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cmake
This will pull down the newest CMake release from Kitware’s servers and integrate it seamlessly with apt 
apt.kitware.com
.

2. Using Snap
If you prefer Snap, this is a one-line method that keeps CMake automatically up-to-date:

sudo snap install cmake --classic
Snaps are confined but the --classic flag gives CMake the usual access it needs. You’ll always get the latest stable release as soon as it’s published 
GitLab
.

3. Official Binary Installer
For maximum control or unusual environments, download and run CMake’s official shell installer:

Go to the CMake Downloads page and grab the cmake-*-linux-x86_64.sh for the latest release 
CMake
.

In your shell:

chmod +x cmake-*-linux-x86_64.sh
sudo ./cmake-*-linux-x86_64.sh --skip-license --prefix=/usr/local
This installs CMake under /usr/local/bin without polluting your package database.

4. In a GitHub Actions Workflow
If you’re setting up CI on ubuntu-24.04, use a dedicated Action to pull in the latest CMake:

name: Build with CMake

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install latest CMake
        uses: jwlawson/actions-setup-cmake@v2
        with:
          cmake-version: 'latest'

      - name: Configure with CMake
        run: cmake -B build -S .

      - name: Build
        run: cmake --build build -- -j$(nproc)
This Action ensures the path is updated so that invoking cmake uses the newest release rather than the runner’s default 
GitHub
.

Choosing the Right Method
Systemwide: Use the Kitware APT repo if you want to manage CMake with apt.

Quick & Automatic: Use Snap for minimal effort and auto-updates.

Portable: Use the binary installer when you can’t add repos or snaps.

CI/CD: Use the GitHub Action for workflows that demand reproducible, up-to-date CMake.

Pick the approach that best fits your environment!

I want to do it with 1. Using the Kitware APT Repository. Give me a.valid .yml for github
ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here's a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file that installs the latest CMake version using the Kitware APT repository on an Ubuntu 24.04 runner:

name: Install Latest CMake via Kitware APT

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  install-cmake:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Remove existing CMake
        run: |
          sudo apt remove --purge --auto-remove -y cmake

      - name: Install prerequisites
        run: |
          sudo apt update
          sudo apt install -y wget gnupg lsb-release ca-certificates

      - name: Add Kitware APT repository
        run: |
          wget -O - https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc \
            | gpg --dearmor - \
            | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/kitware-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
          echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kitware-archive-keyring.gpg] \
            https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" \
            | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kitware.list > /dev/null

      - name: Update and install latest CMake
        run: |
          sudo apt update
          sudo apt install -y cmake

      - name: Verify CMake installation
        run: cmake --version
Notes:
This workflow removes any existing CMake installation to prevent conflicts.

It installs necessary prerequisites like wget, gnupg, lsb-release, and ca-certificates.

The Kitware APT repository is added securely using a GPG key.

After updating the package lists, it installs the latest version of CMake available in the Kitware repository.

Finally, it verifies the installation by printing the installed CMake version.

Important: As of now, the Kitware APT repository does not officially support Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat). You might encounter issues when trying to add the repository or install packages from it. Please refer to the Kitware APT Repository for the most up-to-date information on supported Ubuntu versions.

If you need assistance with alternative methods to install the latest CMake version on Ubuntu 24.04, feel free to ask!

Explanation of Key Steps
actions/checkout@v4 clones your repository into the runner’s workspace so subsequent steps can access your code 
GitHub
.

sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove cmake ensures no conflicting older CMake remains before adding a new source

.

Kitware’s official apt repository is added by importing its GPG key and pointing apt at the “noble” distribution for Ubuntu 24.04 
apt.kitware.com
.

Finally, a fresh sudo apt-get install cmake pulls the latest upstream CMake package and cmake --version confirms success
